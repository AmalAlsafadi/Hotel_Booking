# Hotel_Booking

## In this project I use POSTGRESQL to import, clean, prep data and answer some of stackholders questions.

## This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information 
such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the 
number of available parking spaces, among other things.

# Data covers period from July 2018 to August 2020, where each year has its own table.
# THe questions that were invistigated are:
  
   1. What is the booking distribution for both hotels?
   2. What is the booking distribution for both hotels per year?
   3. Find the countries that has the maximum and minimum number of guests
   4. Is Hotel revenue growing by year? 
   5. Should we increase car parking spaces?
